Sample EM Algorithm for Brain Segmentation from http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~koen/PVEM.html

 *  * The algorithm is described in the following paper:
 *         K. Van Leemput, F. Maes, D. Vandermeulen, P. Suetens, 
 *         A unifying framework for partial volume segmentation of brain MR images, 
 *         IEEE transactions on medical imaging, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 105-119, January 2003
 *
 * The full algorithm is more general than what's implemented here, as it allows for multiple channels and more sophisticated 
 * spatial priors. 
 * 
 * This applet merely serves as a demonstration of the principle; hopefully it also convinces you that uniform 
 * priors on partial volume mixing fractions are not necessarily a good idea. See the paper for a full discussion.

 * Please do send me your comments and suggestions.

A Sample program about EM Algorithm for Brain Segmentation from Koen Van Leemput, and based from his paper.
I try to recode the code, and code it in swing container, and change some information that showed in the application.
